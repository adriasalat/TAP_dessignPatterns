/**
 * @author Adri√† Salat
 * Client demo for the Proxy (Virtual Proxy) pattern.
 *
 * What this shows:
 * 1) The client holds a reference of type Image (the Subject).
 * 2) The client instantiates a ProxyImage with a file name, but the heavy RealImage
 *    is NOT created yet (lazy initialization).
 * 3) On the first call to display(), the proxy constructs RealImage and you will see:
 *      - "Loading test_10mb.jpg"   (from RealImage constructor via loadFromDisk)
 *      - "Displaying test_10mb.jpg" (from RealImage.display)
 * 4) On subsequent display() calls, the proxy reuses the already-created RealImage,
 *    so you will only see:
 *      - "Displaying test_10mb.jpg"
 *    (no loading again).
 * 5) For comparison, we also instantiate RealImage directly to show that it loads
 *    immediately upon construction.
