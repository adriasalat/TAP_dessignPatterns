 * Proxy (Virtual Proxy) that implements the same Subject interface (Image)
 * and controls access to the RealSubject (RealImage).
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Lazy initialization: delays creating the RealImage until the first time
 *   display() is actually invoked. This saves resources if the image might
 *   never be displayed.
 * - Caching: once the RealImage is created, subsequent display() calls
 *   reuse the same instance, avoiding repeated expensive work.
